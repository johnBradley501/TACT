The Menu resource is used to define the look of the various TACTprogram's dialog boxes.

@Section(An Example)
The following is a typical MNU resource:

@begin(example,size = 9 pt, leftIndent +0.0 inch)
(*RES OLD MNU 13

                 LETTERS, DIACRITICS, and CONTINUATION Character

Alphabet
 %0_________________________________________________________________________
 %1_________________________________________________________________________
 %2_________________________________________________________________________
 %3_________________________________________________________________________
Diacritics Retained
 %4_________________________________________________________________________
 %5_________________________________________________________________________
Diacritics NonRetained
 %6_________________________________________________________________________
 %7_________________________________________________________________________
Continuation Sequence:  %8_____

  To edit or add material, move to line using UP or DOWN arrowKeys & type.
        When finished, push the ENTER/RETURN key.

@Section(MNU resource concepts)
The Menu resource is different from the Message resource inseveral ways:
@begin(itemize)
Line endings @i{do} matter -- each line of the definitioncorresponds to one line in the corresponding display the userwill see on the screen.

All spaces also matter -- including leading spaces -- and arepreserved in the resulting MNU resource.

Fields (where variable data will be displayed) always begin withthe character "%", and are followed by a number.  They aresimilar to the substitution points we saw in MSG and CHEresources.  However, there are differences as well.  First, thelength of the field is indicated by immediately following thiswith a sequence of underscores.  The total length (from thebeginning "%" to the last underscore will be the length of thefield.  If the field is very short (and they should be when thefield is used as part of a dialog box switch), and the "%" plusnumber is already longer than you want the field to be, put a "|"just past the end: "@t{%|6}" defines a field of one character inlength.
@end(itemize)

As in message resources, Field numbers start at zero and must beconsecutive -- don't skip numbers.

The meaning of each field number is fixed by the TACT programthat uses the MNU resource, and you cannot change it.  However,you can change the order in which any field is presented on thescreen by simply re-ordering the field numbers in the display --although we don't recommend that you do change the order.

Notice, as well, that the size of the window in which the MNUresource will be shown by the TACT program is not controlled bythe number of lines (or the line width) in the resource itself. Instead, this window size is fixed in the TACT program that usesthe MNU resource, and you have no control over it.  If your newresource definition has fewer lines the program will insert blanklines at the end when using the MNU resource.  If you have morelines the TACT program may abort without an error message, orwith an obscure one.  Essentially, you must ensure that your newlayout fits in the same space (depth and length) that the old oneused it is to work correctly.  Furthermore, you must ensure thatall fields are present in your new layout.  Failure to do eitherof these things will ensure disaster!

@Subsection(Switches in MNU resources)
Some positions on the screen are used for TACT's switches.  Forexample:
@begin(example,size = 9 pt, leftIndent +0.0 inch)
(*RES OLD MNU 6
      Names: %0__________________________________________________________
      Ref ID: %1_____________       Numeric:  Yes: %|2 No: %|3
      Number of characters to keep: %4__
*)
@end(example)

The positions labelled "%0", "%1"  and "%4"are used as fieldswhere the user can type text.  Positions 2 and 3 (appearing as"%|2" amd "%|3" to indicate that they are only 1 character long)are positions for the 2 values of a switches.  Clearly by readingthe text in the resource, you can see that "%|2" is the place forthe "Yes" option, and "%|3" is for the "No".  Here again, thetext "Yes" and "No" are not used by the TACT program to indicatewhich is the yes and no switch value -- only the number indicatesthat.  If you wanted to reverse the order for some reason (not,generally, a good idea), you must reverse the positions of "2"and "3" as well:

@begin(example)
Non: %|3 Oui: %|2
@end(example)
