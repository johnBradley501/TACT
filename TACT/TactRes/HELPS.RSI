{B}Help: Introduction{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Welcome to the release 1.2 of TACT.

This introductory message gives some information that will help
you get started using TACT.  To read more than what shows on the
screen, push the {B}PageDown{N} key.  To move "up" in this text, push
the {B}PageUp{N} key.


                       {B}What can I do now?{N}

Before you can make TACT do anything else, you must finish
looking at Help.  Do this by pushing either the "Enter" or "ESC"
key.

Following this, there are two ways to make TACT do something for
you:

    -  You can choose an action from the "Action Bar".  The
       Action Bar is shown on the top line of the screen.  To
       activate it, push either the "Enter" or "Space Bar" keys
       on your keyboard.  For more information on the Action Bar
       type the letter "{B}A{N}" now.

    -  You can push a function key.  In the bottom 4 lines on the
       screen you can see a summary of function key shortcuts.
       For more information on function key operations type "{B}S{N}"
       now.

If you have not yet read the TACT Guide, we urge you to look at
it now.  There is some general information about how TACT is
designed in two help items:
    -  {B}TACT's Working Lists{N}: go to it now by typing the letter
       "{B}L{N}".

    -  {B}TACT's Displays{N}: go to it now by typing the letter "{B}D{N}".

{B}Help: TACT Help{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Both TACT and MAKBAS are provided with a basic HELP facility.
HELP is meant to assist you while you are using TACT or MAKBAS by
reminding you of the formats of various commands, and the use of
the various function keys.  It is not intended that you learn
TACT from the HELP facility alone.  For this purpose, printed
documentation has been prepared, and you should read through it.

You access help by pushing either the F1 key or (from within
TACT) by choosing "HELP" from the action bar.  The help text that
you will see will vary depending upon what TACT is currently
doing for you.

TACT help works as follows:  TACT help is "context sensitive".
This means that the help screen it displays will change depending
on what TACT is doing at the time you push the F1 key.  Each help
message is called an "item".  After you've read the help message
you can dispose of it by pushing the ESC key, or pushing any
Function Key that indicates that you are ready to do some other
operation.

All Help text (including this introduction) is put into a window.
You use the UpArrow, DownArrow, Home, End, PgUp and PgDn keys to
see parts that currently don't fit in the window.

In addition, you can jump directly to a selected list of other
help items by typing certain letters.  To see what other help
items you can jump to, see the section at the end of the item
called "For More Help".

{B}Help: The AutoSelection Rule Dialog Box{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

You use the Rule Dialog Box when you want to ask TACT
automatically to select a list of words or text positions for
you.  Essentially, you must specify a set of criteria that will
tell TACT how to select for you.  TACT will then search its
databases, find the matching items, and create a "Search Result
List", from which you can further select items to create the
"Selected List".

Options are:

{B}Criteria{N}       Four lines are provided upon which you can specify
               the rule TACT is to use to select items for you.
               Criteria are specified in a language with a very
               specific syntax.  For help on the syntax, type "{B}S{N}"
               now.

{B}Config Context{N} You can specify a range of text to be used for
               collocation searches in this area of the screen.

{B}Manual Select{N}  If "Yes" is selected, TACT will present you with a
               selection window as soon as it has created its
               list of items.  If "No" is selected, TACT will not
               present you with a selection window.  You can, of
               course, always invoke the selection window
               yourself using the F3 key.

The Config Context options are:

{B}Unit{N}           Use this field to specify what structural unit
               should be used to define the context for various
               selection options.  To choose the unit from an

               available list, leave the field blank, or type a
               "?".

{B}Context Before{N} Number of units (given above) that should precede
               the unit containing the occurrence. *

{B}Context After{N}  Number of units (given above) that should follow
               the unit containing the occurrence. *


                              {B}Notes{N}

* To specify a context such as "sentence containing the
occurrence" (assuming that sentence is available as a structural
unit), specify Context Unit as "sentence", Before and After
values of "0".

{B}Help: TACT's Working Lists{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


TACT works with several different lists:

  Base Lists:

 ---------------
|               |
| List Of Words |
|               |
 ---------^F3---    -----------    ----------    ----------
      |            |           |  |          |  |          |
      >>>>>>>>>>>>>| Selection |>>| Selected |>>|   List   |
      |            |   Window  |  |   List   |  | Displays |
      |            |           |  |          |  |          |
 ---------------    -------F3--    ----------    ----------
|               |
| Search Result |
|     List      |
|               |
 ---------F2----

To use TACT you must either select a set of words from the List
of words, or give TACT a search strategy whereby it can select a
list of words, or positions in the text that meet its
requirements.

   1.  If you have indicated that the base list is the list of
       words found in your text, then TACT's selection window
       (presented to you when you push F3) will show you a list
       of all the words in the text.  You can select words that
       interest you, to create the {B}Selected List{N}.

   2.  Instead of selecting from the list of words, you can ask
       TACT to preselect words or text positions for you.  You do
       this by either selecting {B}Rule{N} from the {B}Action Bar's Select{N}
       menu, or by pushing {B}F2{N} -- the short cut.

       If you have provided TACT with a Search Strategy (via F2)
       then the Selection Window (Short Cut: F3) will show all
       the words or positions that TACT selected.  You can then
       only select a subset of this list to create the {B}Selected{N}
       {B}List{N}.

   3.  When you are finished using a list created by a search
       strategy, and again wish to select words based on the
       entire vocabulary, you can indicate this by either
       selecting {B}WordList{N} from the {B}Action Bar Select{N} menu, or by
       pushing {B}Ctrl-F3{N} (which is TACT's shortcut).  In response,
       TACT will first throw away both the Search Result list it
       created, and the selected list.  However, you can then use
       the Selection Window ({B}F3{N}) to select from the list of
       words.

TACT uses the selected list to create displays: KWIC displays, a
text window with selected spots in the text highlighted, an
index, or a distribution list.  For more information on these,
type "{B}D{N}" now.

{B}Help: TACT's main Selection Display{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Use TACT's main selection window when you want to select objects
to be included in TACT's displays, or to be included in TACT's
categories.

The display will appear in two situations:

    -  When you ask for it (by choosing List from the Action
       Bar's Select menu) or by pushing {B}F3{N}.

    -  After TACT has preselected items for you using the
       criteria you gave in the Autoselection Rule Menu.

The display consists of a list of objects -- one per line.  The
objects are either the complete list of vocabulary words, the
contents of one or more categories (if you earlier selected
categories via the Category option on the Action Bar's Select
menu) or are objects that TACT selected for you from the criteria
you gave.

You use the selection display to indicate which objects are to be
in the selected list.  Objects that are currently in the selected
list have the character "{B}>{N}" in front of them.

One line in the selection list is always highlighted.  To select
or deselect an object you first more the highlighted line to the
object you wish to (de)select.  When the object is highlighted
type the {B}Ins{N} key to select it (if not currently selected) or de-
select it (if currently selected).

When you are finished making selections, push the {B}Enter/Return{N}
key

Type "{B}K{N}" to see a list of all possible key operations you can do
within this display.

       PgDn, Up, Down, or Left and Right cursor keys.  Moving the
       highlighted position in the display will change the
       current position in the text.

    -  {B}To Change the type of display{N}: choose "Current" or "New"
       from the Action Bar.  Other display types are KWIC, Index
       and Text.

Use this panel to change the options associated with the
distribution display.  To confirm any changes you make to the
field associated with this display, push the RETURN/ENTER key.
To cancel without making any changes, push the ESC key.

This panel can appear in two ways, depending upon whether the
distribution type is by Text Position or by Reference.  You can
switch between the two by changing the value of the top switch.

{B}Distribution Type{N}
               Set this switch to indicate how the distribution
               is to be generated:

                   -  {B}Text Position{N} based on the position of the
                      selected items throughout the text.

                   -  {B}Reference{N} based on the value of a reference
                      item.

                   -  {B}Word{N} based on the word type.


If you have currently indicated a distribution by Text Position
or by Word Type, you will see the following other items:

{B}Refs{N}           Specify here the pattern that TACT is to use as
               the reference display for the selected position.

{B}Start{N}          Specify here the starting position for the
               distribution (in terms of a percentage of the
               number of words in the text).

{B}End{N}            Specify here the ending position for the
               distribution (in terms of a percentage of the
               number of words in the text).

{B}By{N}             Specify here the size of the division (in terms of
               a percentage of the total number of words in the
               text).

If you have currently indicated a distribution by Reference, you
will see the following other items:

{B}Refs{N}           Specify here the pattern that TACT is to use as
               the reference display for the selected position.

{B}Selection Ref ID{N}
               Specify here the reference name to be used for the
               distribution.  To select the name from a list of
               all references, either leave the field blank, or

Use TACT's category selection windows when you want to create a
list for display with objects contained in your category lists.
TACT will present you with all your category names, one per line.

You should use the selection display to indicate which categories
are to be in the selected list.  Categories whose contents are
currently selected have the character "{B}>{N}" in front of them.

One line in the selection list is always highlighted.  To select
or deselect an object you first move the highlighted line to the
object you wish to (de)select.  When the object is highlighted,
type the {B}Ins{N} key to select it (if not currently selected) or de-
select it (if currently selected).

When you are finished making selections, push the {B}Enter/Return{N}
key.

{B}Help: Printing from TACT{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

By pushing the F6 function key or choosing "Print" from the
Action Bar's "File" menu, you will cause TACT to print something
for you.  TACT can print three things for you:

    -  The active display.

    -  The contents of the current selection window

    -  A Help Item

Printing a Help item, or the current selection window is only
available by using the F6 function key, since the Action Bar
cannot be made active when inside a selection window, or a help
display.

The Print dialog box contains three fields:

    -  {B}Printer{N}: identifies which printer you want to print to.
       Valid options are "LPT1", "LPT2", "LPT3", "COM1" and
       "COM2".

    -  {B}Translation{N}: identifies which translation table TACT is to
       use when printing.  The translation table tells TACT how
       to print characters and certain attributes such as "bold".

    -  {B}Number of lines per page{N}: tells TACT how many lines you
       want per printer page (pages are separated by ASCII Form-
       Feed characters).  Put "0" (zero) if you want no page
       separation.

When you are ready to print, push the "Enter/Return" key.  To
avoid printing at this point, push the ESC key.  During printing
you can type any key to interrupt.

By pushing the Ctrl-F6 function key or choosing "Disk" from the
Action Bar's "File" menu, you will cause TACT to write something
into a file on disk for you. TACT can write three types of
reports:

    -  The active display.

    -  The contents of the current selection window

    -  A Help Item

Printing a Help item, or the current selection window is only
available by using the F6 function key, since the Action Bar
cannot be made active when inside a selection window, or a help
display.

The Disk Write dialog box contains two fields:

    -  {B}File Name{N}: identifies the file to which you wish to write.
       If the file does not exist, TACT will create it.  If it
       does exist TACT will append onto the end of it.  DOS
       WildCard characters "*" and "?" can be used.  If used,
       TACT will generate a selection window showing the names of
       all files that match the wildcard specification, and you
       can select one.

    -  {B}Translation{N}: identifies which translation table TACT is to
       use when writing the file.  The translation table tells
       TACT how to write characters and certain attributes such
       as "bold".

When you are ready to write to the file, push the "Enter/Return"
key.  To avoid writing at this point, push the ESC key.  During
writing you can type any key to interrupt.

       the rule file and present you with a selection list from
       which you can choose a rule.

       If the name you give is already used in the file, TACT
       will replace the old rule in the file with the new one

{B}Help: Introduction to MAKBAS{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Welcome to MAKBAS for TACT system 1.2.

The rest of this introduction message is a some information that
will help to get you started using MAKBAS.  To read more than
what shows on the screen, push the {B}PageDown{N} key.  To move "up" in
this text, push the {B}PageUp{N} key.


                       {B}What can I do now?{N}

Before you can make MAKBAS do anything else, you must finish
looking at Help.  Do this by pushing either the "Enter" or "ESC"
key.

MAKBAS is used to produce a textual database for TACT from an
input source text.  At this point you can do three things:

   1.  You can stop MAKBAS immediately by pushing the F10 key.

   2.  You can check over and alter if necessary the assumptions
       MAKBAS will make about the text file it is about to work
       on.

   3.  When you're ready you can ask MAKBAS to proceed to create
       the textual database by pushing the "Enter/Return" or "F9"
       function keys.


                       {B}On the Front Panel{N}

You can change the names of the file MAKBAS is going to work with
by moving the cursor to the appropriate field and editing the
text.  You can specify the name of the text that will be stored
in the textual database by modifying "{B}DB Title{N}".  You can give an
initial reference template for this database by entering a
template in the "{B}Starting Ref{N}" area.  Finally, you can tell
MAKBAS to create scratch files on a different device or directory
by coding your device or directory in the "{B}Temporary File Area{N}".



                        {B}MAKBAS SubPanels{N}

You can change other information MAKBAS will use to process your
text by asking TACT to show you the appropriate subpanel, and
then changing its contents.  The subpanels are:

    -  {B}Alphabet{N}: This is the place where you can identify the
       letters of the alphabet and other characters related to
       words.  Type {B}F2{N} for this.

    -  {B}Special Characters{N}: This is the place where you can
       identify bracketting characters that surround text to be
       ignored, brackets that surround COCOA-type references, or
       strings of characters that need to be explicitly coded as
       word-separators.  Type {B}F3{N} for this.

    -  {B}Structural Information{N}: This is the place where you tell
       MAKBAS how to identify and process the structural
       information in your text.  This information can be coded
       as counter characters, or by using BYU or COCOA-type
       references. Type {B}F4{N} for this.

{B}Help: MAKBAS's Letters Diacritics ... Panel{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


Use this panel to control the characters MAKBAS will recognize as
letters, diacritics and the continuation character when
processing your text to produce a textual database.

To change the specification, move to the appropriate set of
fields and edit what's there.

Objects that this Panel controls are:

{B}Letters{N}        Characters that can appear in words and are used
               for alphabetization.

{B}Retained Diacritics{N}
               Symbols that are not letters for alphabetization
               purposes, but can appear within words, and should
               be retained as a part of the word.

{B}NonRetained Diacritics{N}
               Symbols, similar to Retained Diacritics, that may
               appear within a word, and are not to be considered
               for alphabetization purposes.  However, unlike
               Retained Diacritics, they will not be retained as
               a part of the word.

{B}Continuation Symbol{N}
               A symbol that, when appearing at the end of a line
               of text, indicates that the word continues on the
               next line.

{B}Help: MAKBAS's Special Characters Panel{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Use this panel to control the characters MAKBAS will recognize
for several purposes.  First, choose the type of character(s) you
wish to specify by setting the switch in the current display:

{B}Ignore{N}         Pairs of symbols that are to be used to surround
               text that is to be ignored by MAKBAS.

{B}Reference{N}      Pairs of symbols that are to be used to delimit
               COCOA-type text references.

{B}Word Sep Seq{N}   Symbols that are to be recognized as a word
               separator.

The information in this panel is maintained as a list.
Information about each character is stored as an entry in this
list.  You can perform the following types of operations on
entries:

   1.  {B}To create a new entry{N}, move to the end of the list (using
       the End key) and change the type switch from "Empty" to
       the type of entry you wish to create.

   2.  {B}To delete an existing entry{N}, find the entry you wish to
       dispose of (the PgUp and PgDn keys will move you between
       entries) and change the switch value to "Empty".

   3.  {B}To change an existing entry{N}, find the entry you wish to
       change and modify the fields to suit your purposes.  The
       Up and Down arrow keys will move you between fields in
       entries.


            {B}Fields for Ignore and Reference brackets{N}

    -  {B}Open Bracket{N}: Specify here the string of characters to
       mark the front of the ignore or reference string.

    -  {B}Close Bracket{N}: Specify here the string of characters to
       mark the end of the ignore or reference string.

    -  {B}Suppress Text{N}: "Yes" indicates that brackets and text are
       not to appear in textual database.

    -  {B}Word Separator{N}: "Yes" indicates that an occurrence of this
       ignore or reference string always separates words.

{B}Help: MAKBAS's Structure Panel{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Use this panel to specify the text structure MAKBAS will
recognize while creating the textual database.  You can specify
the following information:

    o  Which of the pieces of structural information are to be
       given to TACT.

    o  How counters are organized hierarchically.

    o  How labels are to be recognized.

    o  Which BYU-type control data is to be recognized.

The information in this panel is maintained as a list.
Information about each character is stored as an entry in this
list.  You can perform the following types of operations on
entries:

   1.  {B}To create a new entry{N}, move to the end of the list (using
       the End key) and change the type switch from "Empty" to
       the type of entry you wish to create.

   2.  {B}To delete an existing entry{N}, find the entry you wish to
       dispose of (the PgUp and PgDn keys will move you between
       entries) and change the switch value to "Empty".

   3.  {B}To change an existing entry{N}, find the entry you wish to
       change and modify the fields to suit your purposes.  The
       Up and Down arrow keys will move you between fields in
       entries.


                   {B}Types of Objects Available{N}

    -  {B}Reference{N}: Choose this object to tell MAKBAS how to handle
       COCOA-like references in your text.

    -  {B}Label{N}: Choose this object to tell MAKBAS how to handle
       references which are differentiated by different types of
       brackets.

    -  {B}Counter{N}: Choose this object to tell MAKBAS how to handle
       references which are marked by single characters or short
       sequences in your text.  The counter value will be a
       number: the number of times the given character or
       characters occurred.

    -  {B}BYU{N}: Choose this object to tell MAKBAS how to handle
       references given in the BYU format.


                             {B}Fields{N}

{B}The "TACT ID:" field{N} is present in all submenus in the Structural
Information SubPanel.  On it you give the name or names by which
you wish to refer to the item when using TACT.  Although these
names are provided principally to give you access to the data in
TACT, they are also used within MAKBAS when you need to make a
reference from one type of structural information to another.

{B}The "Text ID:" field{N} is used in reference and BYU-type entries.
It is the place where you identify which Text reference you are
talking about.  For example, a COCOA-type reference "<a 1>" has a
Ref ID of "a".  The BYU reference "|a 1" has a Ref ID of "a"
also.

{B}Numeric:{N} This switch allows you to indicate whether the data
associated with the Ref ID are numeric.  Among other things,
tagging the data as numeric ensures that TACT will sort that data
numerically.

{B}Number of characters to keep:{N} If the value is a character string,
this option allows you to indicate how many characters from the
front of the string are to be passed to TACT.

{B}Open and Close Brackets:{N} These fields appear only in "label-type"
entries.  Use them to specify the type of brackets that surround
text labels.

{B}The counter ID{N} appears only in Counter entries and allows you to
specify what MAKBAS should look for in the text to increment the
counter.  There are two types of objects that can cause MAKBAS to
increment a counter:

   1.  One or more symbols.  In the case where the counter is
       associated with sentence punctuation, you would simply
       give the punctuation symbols, separated from each other by
       spaces, e.g.: {B}Counter ID: . ? !{N}

   2.  One or more text references or labels.  In this case, you
       first give an at-sign (``@''), and then immediately
       following one of the TACT names you have associated with
       the text reference or label that you wish to tie the
       counter to.

{B}Reset{N}: In this field (only in counters) you can enter the TACT
names of one or more other counters that are to be reset by the
occurrence of the present counter.  To reset a sentence counter
for each paragraph, enter the sentence counter name in the reset
field of the paragraph counter.

{B}Init{N}: In this field (in counter entries only) you can tell MAKBAS
what to set the counter to at the beginning, and what to reset it
to, when it is to be reset.

{B}Suppress Text{N}: This switch allows you to indicate whether or not
MAKBAS is to include the label as text in the textual database --
or not.  If "Yes", MAKBAS will process and extract the
information it finds and make it available to TACT, but the
actual display of the reference information as it appears in the
input text will not appear in the textual database saved for
TACT's use.

{B}Help: Introduction to MERGEBAS{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Welcome to MERGEBAS for TACT version 1.2.

The rest of this introduction message is a some information that
will help to get you started using MERGEBAS.  To read more than
what shows on the screen, push the {B}PageDown{N} key.  To move "up" in
this text, push the {B}PageUp{N} key.


                       {B}What can I do now?{N}

Before you can make MERGEBAS do anything else you must finish
looking at Help.  Do this by pushing either the "Enter" or "ESC"
key.

MERGEBAS is used to combine a collection of 1-4 textual databases
(that you've already created using MAKBAS) into one large
database.

   1.  You can stop MERGEBAS immediately by pushing the F10 key.

   2.  You can check over and alter if necessary the
       specifications MERGEBAS will use about the textual
       databases it is about to work on.

   3.  When you're ready you can ask MERGEBAS to start to create
       the merged textual database by pushing the "Enter/Return"
       or "F9" function keys.
                      {B}On the Control Panel{N}

You can change the names of the files with which MERGEBAS is
going to work by moving the cursor to the appropriate field and
editing the text.  The fields and their meanings are:

    o  {B}Output Database{N}: This is where you give MERGEBAS the name
       of the merged textual database it is going to create for
       you.  Make sure that the name you give is different from
       all other databases you have already created.

    o  {B}Output Title{N}: This is the title that MERGEBAS will store
       in the database MERGEBAS is going to create for you.  This
       field is optional.

    o  {B}Starting Ref{N}: This is the reference template that MERGEBAS
       will store in the database it is going to create for you.
       If left blank, MERGEBAS will take the first reference
       template it finds among the input databases and copy this
       into the output database.

    o  {B}Save Titles as{N}: If you wish, MERGEBAS can save the titles
       of the input databases as reference information within the
       resulting database.  Put a reference name here if you wish
       MERGEBAS to do this for you.

    o  {B}Input DataBases{N}: Put the names of two, three, or four
       existing databases you want to use for input to MERGEBAS.
       You must give at least 2 input databases to MERGEBAS.

    o  {B}DB Title{N}: MERGEBAS will provide the database text name
       that was stored in the input database in this field for
       you.  If you are saving these names as references, you may
       wish to change them by typing in new information here, or
       by editing the existing information.

{B}Help: Selection Rules: Syntax{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

This is a simplification of the full specification language.  See
the TACT Guide for a more complete description.

All TACT selection criteria specifications start with some type
of initial selection called a {B}source{N}.  Some also contain
{B}refinements{N} or {B}filters{N} that modify the initial selection.
The general form is:

{B}<sources> [ ; <refinements> ]{N}

Note that the refinement section is optional, but, if used, must
be preceded by a semicolon.


                        {B}Selection Sources{N}

The <source> can consist of several selection items separated by
commas:

<source 1> , <source 2> , ...

The following are legal sources:

    o  {B}Vocabulary Words{N}: Any vocabulary word can be given.  If
       the word is reserved within TACT, precede it with an
       (unmatched) '"', e.g. {B}"when{N}.  To manually select words
       from the vocabulary list specify {B}"?{N} as the source.

    o  {B}Regular Expressions{N}: For more information about Regular
       Expression syntax, type "{B}R{N}" now.

    o  {B}Category{N}: To enter a category type "@" followed by the
       category name, e.g.: "{B}@tobe{N}".  You can select a category
       by a list by typing "{B}@?{N}" as a source.

    o  {B}Frequency{N}: The {B}FREQ{N} selection criteria can be used as a
       source or a refinement to select words according to
       frequency of occurrence.  For more information about it
       type "{B}F{N}" now.

    o  {B}Current Selected List{N}: The current selected list can be
       "fed into" the autoselection as a source by including a {B}@{N}
       by itself (not following it by a category name).

    o  {B}SIMIL{N}: The SIMIL selector selects word types based on
       their similarity to a given pattern, e.g.: "{B}SIMIL love{N}
       {B}70%{N}".  This selects words with letter sequences that are
       more than 70% similar to "love".

    o  {B}Phrase Selection{N}: Any of the above selection tools can be
       combined into phrases by joining them with the "{B}|{N}"
       operator, e.g. "{B}my | lov.*{N}" chooses phrases beginning with
       the word "my" and followed immediately by any word
       starting with "lov".  The "{B}>{N}" character can be used to
       select positions other than the first word in the phrase:
       e.g. "{B}my | > lov.*{N}" will save the "lov" words.  The ">"
       character may be placed by itself before or after the
       phrase: "{B}> | my | lov.*{N}" chooses all word immediately
       before the phrase; "{B}my | > | lov.*{N}" chooses all phrases
       beginning with the word "my", followed by any word, and
       then followed by a "lov" word.  The middle, unspecified,
       word is saved in the resulting list.

    o  {B}Co-occurrence Selection{N}: Any of the above selection tools
       can be combined into expressions involving the co-
       occurrence operators "{B}&{N}", "{B}~{N}".  For more information about
       the co-occurrence syntax, type "{B}C{N}" now.

    o  {B}Exclusion{N}: Similarly, the "{B}-{N}" operator can be used:
       <source 1> - <source 2> produces a list of items that are
       in <source 1> but are not in <source 2>.

                      {B}Selection Refinements{N}

A refinement can follow any source or source group.  It begins
with a semicolon.  More than one refinement can be given -- in
which case separate each by a semi-colon:

<sources> ; <refinement> [; <refinement> ...] )

There are several different refinement operators to choose from.
All refinement operators begin with a name, and some are followed
by some further specification information.

    o  {B}FREQ{N}: The FREQ operator can be used as a refinement.  For
       more information about it, type "{B}F{N}" now.

    o  {B}POS{N}: The POS operator needs no further specification
       information.  It transforms each word (type) entry it is
       given into a list of positions where that word occurs:
       e.g: "{B}earth; pos{N}"

    o  {B}REGEXP{N}: Regular expressions can be used as a refinement,
       e.g.: "{B}@goldtheme;  REGEXP a.*{N}" chooses all positions in
       category GoldTheme that are assigned to words beginning
       with the letter "a".  For more information on regular
       expression syntax, type "{B}R{N}" now.

    o  {B}WHEN{N}: Can be used to select positions based on structural
       information in the text.  For more information, type "{B}W{N}"
       now.

    o  {B}SIMIL{N}: The SIMIL operator (described above) can also act
       as a refinement, e.g.: "{B}l.*; simil love 75%{N}" will select
       all words beginning with "l" that are more than 75%
       similar to "love".

    o  {B}SPAN{N}: The SPAN operator creates a resulting list that
       consists of all word tokens "near" to the given inputted
       positions ("near" is defined by the AutoSelection Dialog
       Box's "Config Context").  If the configuration context was
       5 words on either side, for example, the selection "{B}love;{N}
       {B}span{N}" would select all words that occur within 5 words of
       "love" in the text.

{B}Help: Regular Expression Syntax{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Regular Expressions can be specified (a) as a source in a
selection criteria statement, (b) as a refinement, or (c) as a
part of a WHEN selection.  In the first two instances it selects
word types in the last case it selects values for structural
references.

Format is a string of letters or diacritics with special
characters that have special meanings interspersed.  In the
following, the term "word letter" means letter or diacritic.
Special characters are:

    o  {B}"."{N}: Means "any word letter"

    o  {B}"[...]"{N}: Means "any one of the word letters between the
       brackets": e.g. "[aeiou]" means "any vowel".  If an
       alphabetically consecutive set of letters is desired, use
       the range selector {B}":"{N} -- [a:e] means all letters between
       "a" and "e".


    o  {B}"[~...]"{N}: Means "any word letter BUT the word letters
       between the brackets": e.g. "[~aeiou]" means "any letter
       BUT a vowel".

    o  {B}"*"{N}: Means "zero or more occurrences of the PRECEDING word
       letter".  e.g. "e*" means "zero or more occurrences of the
       word letter 'e'", ".*" means "zero or more occurrences of
       any word letter", "[ae]*" means "zero or more occurrences
       of either the letter "e" or "a".

    o  {B}"\"{N}: Means "treat the following character as a letter or
       diacritic in a regular expression."

Some examples:

{B}b.t{N}            Any three-letter word beginning with the letter
               "b" and ending with the letter "t".

{B}b.*t{N}           Any word of any length beginning with the letter
               "b" and ending with "t".

{B}ba...{N}          Any five letter word beginning with the sequence
               "ba".

{B}.[bt].{N}         Any three-letter word containing, as the middle
               letter, the letter "b" or "t".

{B}.[~bt].{N}        Any three-letter word containing, as the middle
               letter, any letter BUT the letters "b" or "t".

{B}.*b.*{N}          Any word containing the letter "b" in any
               position.

{B}.*ing{N}          Any word ending with the letter sequence "ing".

{B}.*lov.*{N}        Any word containing the letter sequence "lov".

{B}Help: Co-occurrence Syntax{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Use the co-occurrence operators when you wish to select positions
where two or more words happen near to each other.  Co-occurrence
operators always produce a list of positions in the text -- they
can never generate a list of words.

There are three co-occurrence operators.  To use, replace
"<item1>" and "<item2>" with a subordinate rule (such as a
regular expression).

    o  {B}<item1> & <item2>{N}
       The resulting list will contain positions where item1
       occurs that also have an occurrence of item2 within the
       range of text controlled by the context.  The context is
       specified in the "Config Context" section of the
       Autosection rule window (see below).  This is the {B}and{N}
       operation.

    o  {B}<item1> ~ <item2>{N}
       The resulting list will contain positions where item1
       occur that {B}do not{N} have an occurrence of item2 within the
       range of text controlled by the context.  The context is
       specified in the "Config Context" section of the
       Autosection rule window (see below).  This is the
       {B}exclusion{N} operation.

Items within the list can be a word from the vocabulary, a
regular expression, a category name, or many other basic
selection rule types. In addition, an item may be any further
subordinate co-occurrence selection criteria.  In this case, the
subordinate criteria must be surrounded by brackets "(" and ")".


                            {B}Examples{N}

Two simple examples:

    o  {B}Metro.* ~ Toronto.*{N}
       This rule will select positions in the text showing all
       occurrences of the word beginning with the letters "METRO"
       that doesn't have a word beginning with "TORONTO" nearby.

    o  {B}a & the{N}
       This rule will select all occurrences of "a" that occur
       within the given Config context in association with
       occurrences of "the".

{B}Help: FREQ Selection{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Use the FREQ selection operator when you want to select words
based on frequency of occurrence.  When used as a source (e.g.
"{B}FREQ 5{N}"), FREQ selects words based on their frequency in the
entire text.  When used as a refinement (e.g. "{B}l.* ; FREQ 5{N}",
words are selected according to their number of occurrences in
the given list.

You give numbers to use as criteria for frequency selection.  The
forms are:

    o  You can give a single number, or number range: "{B}FREQ 5{N}" or
       "{B}FREQ 5:8{N}".

    o  You can use the "<", "<=", ">", or ">=" operators: "{B}FREQ{N}
       {B}<= 6{N}".

    o  If you enclose the specification in parentheses, you can
       specify more than one condition, separating each by a
       comma: "{B}FREQ (< 10, > 100){N}", "{B}FREQ (10:12, 50:58){N}".

{B}Help: WHEN refinement{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

The WHEN refinement allows you to select positions in the text
where a particular structural condition is true, for example,
when the speaker is Romeo.
The following is a partial description of WHEN refinement syntax.
For more information, refer to the TACT Guide.

An example of WHEN refinement in use is:

     lov.* ; when speaker = romeo


                  {B}Simple WHEN Selection Format{N}

The general format of the basic WHEN selection is:

     {B}<choose from> ; WHEN <Ref ID> = <selection list>{N}

The elements are:

{B}<choose from>{N}  This is the specification for the primary list
               from which the WHEN specification will choose in
               order to create a secondary list.  The <choose
               from> specification is often a word, word list, or
               regular expression, but it can be created in other
               ways.

{B}<Ref ID>{N}       This is the name of the piece of structural
               information we want to use as the basis of our
               refinement selection.  To select from a list of
               possible items for this database, enter a "?" in
               the specification.

{B}<selection list>{N}
               This element tells TACT to include in the
               resulting list a particular occurrence from the
               <choose from> list when the occurrence is found in
               a context that has the given value(s) for <Ref
               ID>.  To select from a list of possible items for
               this database, enter a "?" in the specification.
               This will only work if the unit is not numeric.

The selection list format can be:

    o  A single name: ... ; WHEN speaker = {B}juliet{N}

    o  A list of names (separated by commas): ... ; WHEN speaker
       = {B}romeo, juliet{N}

    o  A range of numbers (if reference is numeric): ... ; WHEN
       chapter = {B}10:15{N}

    o  If reference is numeric, you can use "<", ">", "<=" and
       ">=": ... ; WHEN chapter {B}< 15{N}

    o  A question mark (to choose from list -- if reference is
       {B}not{N} numeric): ... ; WHEN speaker = {B}?{N}

    o  A regular expression: ... ; WHEN speaker = {B}j.*{N}

{B}Help: TACT's Displays{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

The main reason to use TACT is to produce and examine displays
based on selected positions in the text.  The selected positions
are stored in a {B}selected list{N}.  This single list is used to drive
all the displays.  Hence, one uses TACT essentially (1) by
selecting items you want to look at, and then (2) by looking at
the results with the TACT displays.  Since all displays run from
the same selection, you can switch among the various displays
without needing to recreate the list.

For help on creating the selected list, look at Help item "TACT's
Working Lists".  You can jump there now by pushing "{B}L{N}".

TACT has 5 types of displays:

    o  {B}KWIC Display{N}: shows the selected positions in the text in
       context -- one or more lines surrounding.  For more
       information on the KWIC Display, see Help item "TACT's
       KWIC Display" (push "{B}K{N}" now).

    o  {B}Text Display{N}: shows the selected positions in the body of
       the text.  The text is shown as if you were browsing it
       in, say, a word processor.  For more information on the
       TEXT Display, see Help item "TACT's TEXT Display" (push
       "{B}T{N}" now).

    o  {B}Distribution Display{N}: displays distribution graphs showing
       how the selected positions are scattered through the text,
       or among various textual structural divisions.  For more
       information on the Distribution Display, see Help item
       "TACT's Distribution Display" (push "{B}D{N}" now).

    o  {B}Index Display{N}: generates an index of the positions -- each
       index entry is 1 line.    For more information on the
       Index Display, see Help item "TACT's Index Display" (push
       "{B}I{N}" now).

    o  {B}Collocate Display{N}: generates a list of words near to the
       selected positions.  For more information on the Collocate
       Display, see Help item "TACT's Collocate Display" (push
       "{B}C{N}" now).

The basic way to select a display to look at is to choose it from
the "{B}Current{N}" menu on the action bar.  Once you have selected the
display you can modify some aspects of it by pushing {B}F4{N} and
changing the settings you'll then see.

{B}Help: TACT's Collocate Display{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

The Collocate display produces a list of collocates for each word
or word-pattern sorted into descending order by their z-scores (a
measure of the attraction of the collocate to the word or word-
pattern, based on a comparison of the expected number of co-
occurrences (assuming a random distribution through the text) to
the actual number of co-occurrences within the span.

    -  {B}To move about in the display{N}: use the Home, End, PgUp,
       PgDn, Up, Down, or Left and Right cursor keys.  Moving the
       selected node in the display will change the current
       position in the text.

    -  {B}To Change the type of display{N}: choose "Current" or "New"
       from the Action Bar.  Other display types are KWIC, Index
       and Text.

    -  {B}To Change some option associated with the Collocate{N}
       {B}Display{N}: push the F4 Key.

The top line of the display contains the following information:

    -  The reference information for the current position.

    -  The number of words in the "mini-text": the text near to
       the positions in the selected list from which the
       collocates have been drawn.

    -  The total number of words in the entire database.

Following this are several columns of information.  The next two
lines on the display are labels for the columns.  The display has
two modes of operation, showing or suppressing intermediate
results that are produced to calculate the Z-score.  In short
form (suppressing intermediate results) the following data is
displayed:

    -  {B}Collocates:{N}  In this column are the collate word types
       that TACT found.

    -  {B}Sel. Node:{N}  This column is used to indicate the current
       position in the selected list.  By pushing the Up and Down
       arrow keys, or the PgUp and PgDn keys you can change the
       current position (in the same way as you can for other
       displays).  Pushing the Left and Right arrow keys will
       move you between different occurrences of the current
       collocate headword (if more than 1 occurrence is
       represented in the display).

    -  {B}Collocate Freq:{N}  This is the number of times the collocate
       occurred in the mini-text.

    -  {B}Type Freq:{N}  This is the number of times the word occurred
       in the entire text.

    -  {B}Z-score:{N}  This is the Z-score for the collocate.

The remaining information only appears when intermediate results
are being displayed:

    -  {B}Type Prob.:{N} This is the probability calculated by taking
       the total number of occurrences of the word throughout the
       text and dividing it by the text size.
    -  {B}Expected Observ.:{N} This is the number of observations of
       the word you'd expect to find in the mini-text, based on
       its probability (calculated above).

    -  {B}Standard Dev.:{N} This is the standard deviation, calculated
       for use within the Z-score.

This dialogue box appears when TACT has tryed to open a TDB that
is associated with a PDB and did not succeed.

It can fail for several reasons:

    o  The file named in the PDB no longer exists.

    o  The file named in the PDB is not the correct version.

    o  The file named in the PDB is not a correct TDB file.

The first three lines of the display will describe the problem
TACT is having.

In response, you have several choices:

   1.  You can quit TACT by pushing F10

   2.  If you wish to try a different PDB, push the ESC key.

   3.  Edit or type in a new name of a TDB to try.  If you wish
       you can give a wildcard specification (with DOS's "*" and
       "?" characters).  If you do use wildcards, TACT will
       generate a list of all TDBs that match, and let you choose
       one.

{B}Help: Introduction to COLLGEN{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Welcome to COLLGEN for TACT system 1.2.

The rest of this introduction message is a some information that
will help to get you started using COLLGEN.  To read more than
what shows on the screen, push the {B}PageDown{N} key.  To move "up" in
this text, push the {B}PageUp{N} key.


                        {B}What is COLLGEN?{N}

COLLGEN is a part of the TACT system that can take a TDB file and
produce a complete list of all phrases (where "phrase" simply
means repeated word groups of 2 or more words) found in the TDB
text.  The phrases COLLGEN found can be printed, written to a
file, or stored as a "RUL" file for subsequent use within TACT.


                       {B}What can I do now?{N}

Before you can make COLLGEN do anything else, you must finish
looking at Help.  Do this by pushing either the "Enter" or "ESC"
key.

After you've finished looking at this Help message you can do
three things:

   1.  You can stop COLLGEN immediately by pushing the F10 key.

   2.  You can check over and alter if necessary the assumptions
       COLLGEN will make about the text file it is about to work
       on.

   3.  When you're ready you can ask COLLGEN to proceed to create
       the collocation lists by pushing the "Enter/Return" or
       "F9" function keys.


                       {B}On the Front Panel{N}

The fields on the front panel provide COLLGEN with the following
information:

    o  {B}Input Database{N}: Give the name of the TDB database you want
       to process here.

    o  {B}Temporary FIle Area{N}: Optionally, specify a device and/or
       path where you wish COLLGEN to put its temporary working
       files.  Unless you have a special place to put temporary
       files (such as a large RAM disk, for example) leave this
       field blank.

    o  {B}Span Context{N}: Specify the number of words you want to
       consider for a phrase.  The default, "2 to 2 words",
       indicates that all 2 word phrases are to be considered.
       "2 to 3 words" would indicate all 2 or 3 word phrases.

    o  {B}Number of repetitions to keep{N}: Specify how many times the
       word phrase has to occur to be considered by COLLGEN.  The
       default, "2 or more" indicates that a phrase will appear
       in the output if it occurs 2 or more times in the text.


    o  {B}Generate Collocations{N}: Choose one of the options: "To
       Disk" means that the results will be put in a file.  "To
       Printer" means that the results will be sent to your
       printer.  "No" means that no printed output is desired.

    o  {B}Output File Name{N}: If "To Disk" is chosen, you can specify
       the name of a file to use for the output.  COLLGEN will
       create a default name by taking the name of the TDB file
       and replacing the given filename extension with ".COL".

    o  {B}Generate Rule File{N}: Choose "Yes" to ask COLLGEN to
       generate a RULE file for use within TACT.

    o  {B}Rule File Name{N}: If a Rule File is requested, you can
       specify the name of the rule file here.  COLLGEN will
       create a default name by taking the name of the TDB file
       and replacing the given filename extension with ".RUL".

{B}Help: TACT's Script Files{N}
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

By means of TACT's scripting files you can automatically copy a
sequence of keystrokes during a TACT session, saving them in a
file.  Then, at a future time they can be played back.

Use the "{B}R{N}ecord" item from the Action Bar's "{B}F{N}ile" menu to begin
recording your keystrokes.  Enter the name of a file to use as a
Script file in the dialog box when asked.  To finish recording
once you've started it, type {B}Alt-Esc{N}.  While you are recording
your keystrokes TACT will remind you that you are doing so by
showing "{B}REC{N}" near the right end of the action bar.

To play back a script file use the "pl{B}a{N}y" item from the Action
Bar's "{B}F{N}ile" menu.

While you are recording keystrokes to a script file you can use
three special features that are provided to make script files
more suitable for teaching purposes.  All these features put
special codes in the Script file that will cause TACT to do
something special while playing back the file.

To indicate you want to use one of these features type {B}Ctrl-F10{N}.
In response TACT will put up a special Script instruction window
and wait for your response.

Appropriate responses are:

    o  {B}Esc{N}: Type "Esc" if you wish to get out of the special
       feature mode without putting one in the script.

    o  {B}P{N}ause: Type "P" to ask TACT stop while playing back the
       script file and wait for the TACT user to type something
       at the keyboard.  In this way the script user can study
       the screen.

    o  {B}D{N}elay: Type "D" to ask TACT to play back the keystrokes
       from the script file at a slower (or faster rate).
       Normally TACT will play the keystrokes as quickly as it
       can.  If you type "D" TACT will ask you to specify a time
       (in milli-seconds: 1/1000 of a second) that it is to wait
       between keystrokes.  This will allow the script user time
       to watch the script act.  Enter "0" to turn off the delay.
       Legal values are from 100 milliseconds (1/10 second) to
       10000 milliseconds (10 seconds) between keystrokes.

    o  {B}W{N}indow: Type "W" to ask TACT to display a special comment
       window into which you can put text to be displayed during
       script playback.  If you type "W" TACT will put up an
       empty message window into which you can type material you
       want TACT to display on playback.  Use the {B}F5{N} and {B}Ctrl-F5{N}
       keys to resize and move the window to where you want it to
       be.  For more information about creating the text in this
       display window type "{B}W{N}" now.

Type in the text you wish TACT to display during script playback
into this comment window.  Although TACT does not provide you
with a full word-processor in which to enter your text it gives
you a few very basic facilities.  In addition to the field-
editing features described elsewhere, the following keys are
supported:

    o  {B}Down Arrow{N}: will move you to the next line

    o  {B}Up Arrow{N}: will move you to the previous line

    o  {B}F5{N}: will allow you to resize the comment window

    o  {B}Ctrl-F5{N}: will allow you to place the comment window on the
       screen

    o  {B}Home{N}: will move you to the first line

    o  {B}End{N}: will move you to the last line

    o  {B}Esc{N}: will make TACT remove the comment window without
       creating it.

    o  {B}Enter/Return{N}: will make TACT create the comment window you
       have entered and put it in the script file.
