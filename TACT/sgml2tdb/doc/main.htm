<H4>sgml2tdb is Beta</H4>
<P>This is the supporting materials for <i>SGML2TDB Version 1.0 Beta(a)</i> -- the second release of <i>sgml2tdb</i> that has been made available in May 1997.  The first release was June 1996.

<P>This version of <I>sgml2tdb</I> is still Beta-level software. You should expect that the software may contain bugs and design imperfections. As the I gain more experience processing SGML-based texts, you might also both expect the feature list to grow, and the ways existing features are invoked to change.

<P>Although <I>sgml2tdb </I>is beta-level software, I have no resources other than myself available to rapidly enhance it, and I can only allot a small amount of time to this task. However, I welcome your comments and suggestions, and will update the software based on your comments as time permits. Of course, I will not be able to guarantee that a problem will be fixed in any particular timeframe.

<P>Please send your thoughts to <A HREF="mailto:john.bradley@kcl.ac.uk">john.bradley@kcl.ac.uk</A>.
<H4>License issues for sgml2tdb and its components</H4>
<I>sgml2tdb</I> contains almost all of <I>sgmls</I> -- an SGML parser that was developed by James Clark (<A HREF="mailto:jjc@jclark.com">jjc@jclark.com
</A>). Without his code <I>sgml2tdb</I> would have been too difficult for me to write. Parts of <I>sgmls</I> in turn are derived from <I>arcsgml</I> which was written by Charles F. Goldfarb. Contained within <I>sgmls</I> are also SGML Parser materials provided free by the Standard Generalized Markup Language Users' Group (SGMLUG). The parts that were written by James Clark are in the public domain. The portions of <I>sgml2tdb</I> that are written by me are copyright.  The software may be freely distributed as long as acknowledgement of its original source is preserved.  The source code for the entire package is available on request from me, and may be reused and modified as long as appropriate acknowledgement of its original source is given.
